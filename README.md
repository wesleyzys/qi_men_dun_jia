# Qi Men Dun Jia — Eight Gates Huaqi Array
# 奇门遁甲 八门化气阵

A pure-Bash Qi Men Dun Jia plate-setting engine with zero external dependencies.

## What Is Qi Men Dun Jia?

Qi Men Dun Jia (奇门遁甲) is one of the "Three Styles" (三式) of classical Chinese cosmological forecasting, alongside Tai Yi (太乙) and Liu Ren (六壬). Dating back over two thousand years, it maps time and space onto a nine-palace grid derived from the Luoshu (洛书) magic square, then layers multiple symbol systems on top: heavenly stems, stars, gates, and deities. Each layer interacts through the five-phase (五行, wuxing) cycle of generation and overcoming, producing a rich symbolic picture of a given moment's energetic landscape.

The system was historically used for military strategy, site selection, and timing decisions. Today it remains a living tradition in Chinese metaphysics, studied for both its cultural depth and its internal structural elegance.

## Design Choices

**Zhi-Run intercalary method only.** Two major schools exist for handling the boundary between solar terms: Zhi-Run (置闰法) and Chai-Bu (拆补法). This project implements Zhi-Run exclusively. In Zhi-Run, when the current time falls between the Jieqi (节气) boundary and the start of a new Yuan (元), the previous Ju number is carried forward ("intercalated"). Chai-Bu instead splits and patches across both Ju numbers. Zhi-Run produces a single clean Ju per moment, which simplifies the computation pipeline and aligns with the dominant mainland Chinese tradition.

**Hourly Qi Men with rotating plate.** This is Shi Jia Qi Men (时家奇门), the hourly variant, not the daily or monthly variants. The plate uses the rotating-plate (转盘) method, where stars and gates physically rotate around the nine palaces. The alternative flying-star (飞盘) method assigns symbols by flight path rather than rotation. Rotating plate preserves the spatial relationship between symbols and palaces, making it more intuitive for reading directional significance.

**Tianqin palace assignment.** The star Tianqin (天禽, Heavenly Bird) sits in the center palace (5-palace), which has no gate and therefore needs a hosting palace. Three modes are available via `--tianqin=MODE`:

- **`follow-tiannei`** (default): Tianqin follows wherever Tiannei (天内) goes. When the heaven plate rotates, Tiannei and Tianqin share the same palace. This preserves Tianqin's yin-earth affinity with Tiannei's yin-earth nature.
- **`jikun`**: Tianqin lodges permanently in the Kun 2-palace (寄坤二宫), regardless of plate rotation. This is the most traditional convention.
- **`follow-zhifu`**: Tianqin follows the Zhifu (值符) duty star to its rotated palace.

In all modes, the hosting palace displays Tianqin with a `[寄]` (lodging) marker alongside the palace's own rotated star.

**Pure Bash, no external tools.** The entire engine runs in Bash 3.2+ with no calls to Python, bc, awk, or any other external program. All arithmetic uses Bash integer math. Calendar calculations (Gregorian to Julian Day Number, Ganzhi cycle indexing) are implemented from scratch in shell arithmetic. This makes the tool portable to any system with a POSIX-compatible Bash, including stock macOS.

**Script and data fully separated.** Every domain constant lives in `tools/data/*.dat` files, using a simple `key=value` format. The scripts contain zero hardcoded domain knowledge. You could, in theory, swap the data files to model a different Qi Men variant without touching a line of code.

## Architecture

The engine is split into library files, CLI entry points, and a data directory.

```

**`tools/lib/data_loader.sh`** is a generic key=value file parser. It reads `.dat` files into shell variables and arrays. Comma-separated values become indexed arrays. Keys with CJK characters are stored via an internal key-value store (`dl_get`/`dl_set`) for Bash 3 compatibility, since older Bash lacks associative arrays with non-ASCII keys.

**`tools/lib/qimen_engine.sh`** contains all computation logic: calendar math (Gregorian/JDN conversion, Ganzhi cycle calculation), solar term lookup, Yuan/Ju determination with intercalary handling, and the full plate-laying pipeline (earth plate, heaven plate rotation, gate rotation, deity placement, pattern detection).

**`tools/lib/qimen_output.sh`** reads the global arrays populated by the engine and formats them for display. It supports two modes: human-readable text (palace-by-palace listing with a header block) and structured JSON.

**`tools/lib/qimen_json.sh`** provides shared JSON parsing and utility functions: plate JSON parsing into the dl key-value store, day/hour stem palace location, stem extraction, and wanwu correspondence lookup. Used by all analysis CLI scripts.

**`tools/lib/qimen_event.sh`** provides the event-specific analysis pipeline: yongshen (use god) selection by question type, yongshen palace marking, 81-combination lookups, pattern marker collection, and structured text/JSON output formatting. Used exclusively by `tools/bin/qimen_event.sh`.

**`tools/bin/qimen_qiju.sh`** is the plate-setting CLI wrapper. It parses options, sources the library files, calls the engine, and dispatches to the appropriate output formatter.

**`tools/bin/qimen_event.sh`** is the event analysis CLI. It reads a plate JSON produced by `qimen_qiju.sh`, runs the analysis pipeline, and outputs a structured analysis JSON. Used exclusively for event plates (问事局).

**`tools/lib/qimen_banmenhuaqizhen.sh`** provides the core huaqizhen library: common helpers, palace finders, six-harm (六害) detection per palace with opposite-palace influence (玄武/庚/白虎 affect both host and opposite palace), monthly decree (月令) wuxing relationship computation with Chinese meaning labels (扩张/稳健/努力/损耗/大亏), controlled-wealth (干财) stem tracing with five-combination (天干五合) fallback and special missing-甲-find-zhifu rule (缺甲找值符), symbol location utilities, palace summary generation, yuegling relations, and the full buzhen (布阵) pipeline: protected stem identification (day/hour, birth year, family, yixiang concept stems, zhifu/zhishi), eight-palace six-harm scanning, miexiang (灭象) list generation with safe relocation targets, buzhen plan per palace (suppress jixing via combination, suppress rumu via clash, suppress menpo via combination, suppress geng/baihu via yi-stem, fill kongwang), jinji (禁忌) conflict detection, and physical object imagery mapping.

**`tools/lib/qimen_yishenhuanjiang.sh`** provides the yishenhuanjiang (移神换将) transformation resolution library: detects six-harm problems across all palaces (jixing, rumu, menpo, kongwang, geng, baihu), computes transformation paths per problem type (灭象/暗合/地支合/泄化/冲墓/合出/补象/用乙), resolves physical object imagery via runtime wanwu data lookup, and outputs structured text/JSON with per-problem resolution paths, jinji (禁忌) warnings, and yindong (引动) activation methods. Uses `_yh_` prefix for all helper functions.

**`tools/lib/qimen_caiguan.sh`** provides the caiguan-specific analysis pipeline: seven-hazard (七要害) yaohai analysis for both wealth and career dimensions with monthly decree Chinese meaning labels, gan_cai analysis with special missing-甲-find-zhifu rule (缺甲找值符宫干 instead of 己), industry symbol (hangye) lookup, fushi analysis, tiangan roles analysis, JSON output formatting, and the caiguan pipeline entry point.

**`tools/lib/qimen_hunlian.sh`** provides the hunlian (marriage/romance) analysis pipeline: birth day stem palace location, gan-he (stem combination) partner, liuhe (six harmony), muyu (bathing position), sanqi (three wonders) proximity checks, taohua (peach blossom) detection across multiple indicators (xuanwu, taiyin, ren/gui, sanqi co-location), fuyin/fanyin palace scanning, kongwang impact on partner positions, gen/kun palace six-harm inspection, guchen/guasu (lonely star) computation with jiehua remedies, and special position tracking (tianpeng, shangmen, ding, gui).

**`tools/lib/qimen_xingge.sh`** provides the personality analysis pipeline: birth day stem (inner personality) and hour stem (outer personality) palace location, personality correspondence extraction from huaqizhen-specific wanwu data (stem, star, gate, deity personality traits per palace), wuxing color mapping, and structured text/JSON output.

**`tools/lib/qimen_yaoce.sh`** provides the yaoce (remote sensing) cross-plate analysis library: uses `qj_parse_plate_json` to parse both birth and event plate JSONs, extracts five stem types from the birth plate (day stem, hour stem, birth year stem, zhifu palace heaven stem, zhishi palace heaven stem), locates each on the event plate (heaven plate priority, earth plate fallback), collects palace environment info (stem/star/gate/deity/state/markers), detects six-harm (六害) per palace, extracts wanwu correspondences, and outputs structured text/JSON with per-stem analysis results. Supports optional yixiang (意象) concept stems passed via CLI. Self-contained helper functions (`_yc_` prefix) for stem wuxing, star jixi, and gate jixi lookups with no dependency on qimen_caiguan.sh.

**`tools/lib/qimen_zhanduan.sh`** provides the ancient divination judgment (占断) DSL evaluator library. It reads `rules_zhanduan.dat` containing per-topic role definitions and judgment rules in a custom DSL. The evaluator parses condition expressions (wuxing relationships: `>` sheng, `<` ke, `=` equal, `!` overcome-by, `^` counter-ke; state queries (`?` prefix = unary "is role in this state?", applied to a single role): `?旺` `?囚` `?奇` `?吉门` `?凶门` `?吉格` `?凶格` `?空` `?墓` `?返` `?伏` `?内` `?外`; special: `庚格:年/月/日/时`), resolves role stems to palace positions on the event plate, evaluates all rules collecting matched conclusions, and outputs structured text/JSON. All-match semantics (not first-match). Uses `_zd_` prefix for all helper functions.

**`tools/bin/qimen_caiguan.sh`** is the caiguan diagnosis CLI. It reads the birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`) only. It auto-reads `./qmen_birth.json` for birth year stem, then outputs a structured caiguan analysis JSON with wealth and career hazard diagnostics.

**`tools/bin/qimen_huaqizhen.sh`** is the huaqizhen buzhen CLI. It defaults to birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`); use `--input` to specify an event plate for event-based analysis. It auto-reads `./qmen_birth.json` for birth year stem, takes optional family stems and yixiang concept stems, and outputs a structured buzhen JSON with miexiang list and per-palace placement plans.

**`tools/bin/qimen_yishenhuanjiang.sh`** is the yishenhuanjiang (transformation resolution) CLI. It reads the birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`) and outputs transformation resolution paths for all detected six-harm problems (击刑, 干墓, 门迫, 空亡, 庚, 白虎). For 击刑/干墓/庚, miexiang (灭象) is always the first path. Each problem includes multiple resolution methods with physical object imagery mapped from wanwu data. Problems in the same palace are grouped under a single palace header. Output includes jinji warnings and yindong activation methods. Writes to `./qmen_yishenhuanjiang.json`.

**`tools/bin/qimen_hunlian.sh`** is the hunlian (marriage/romance) analysis CLI. It reads the birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`) only. It auto-reads `./qmen_birth.json` for birth day stem, then outputs a structured hunlian analysis JSON with partner detection, taohua indicators, guchen/guasu assessment, and palace-level relationship diagnostics.

**`tools/bin/qimen_xingge.sh`** is the personality analysis CLI. It reads the birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`) only. It reads the birth day stem and hour stem, locates them on the plate, extracts personality trait correspondences from the star, gate, and deity at each stem's palace, and outputs structured personality analysis JSON.

**`tools/bin/qimen_xunshijieyun.sh`** is the xunshijieyun (寻时借运) CLI. It reads a plate JSON (default `./qmen_birth.json`), generates 60 variant plates by cycling the time pillar through all 60 甲子 while keeping the 局数 fixed, ranks them by total 六害 count on protected stems, and outputs sortable JSON files to `./60ke/`. Protected stems include day stem, hour stem, birth year stem, optional yixiang concept stems, and per-course zhifu/zhishi palace stems.

**`tools/bin/qimen_show.sh`** is a plate JSON viewer. It reads any plate JSON file and displays the full text-format plate (identical to `qimen_qiju.sh` output). Optionally copies the JSON to a specified output path via `--output=PATH`. Used by xunshijieyun to display selected courses from `./60ke/`.

**`tools/bin/qimen_luming.sh`** is the six-relation (六亲禄命) analysis CLI. It reads the birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`), determines the reference stem (year stem by default, day stem optional via `--reference=day`), locates the benming palace (本命宫), assigns six relations (父母/兄弟/子孙/官禄/妻财/疾厄) to each palace based on wuxing relationships, and outputs verdict texts from `rules_luming.dat`. Writes to `./qmen_luming.json`.

**`tools/bin/qimen_zhanduan.sh`** is the zhanduan (古籍占断) divination CLI. It reads an event plate JSON (`./qmen_event.json`) and optionally `./qmen_birth.json` for the birth year stem. Given a topic via `--topic=X`, it applies judgment rules from `rules_zhanduan.dat` and outputs structured text/JSON with all matched conclusions. Without `--topic`, it displays help and the full topic list. Writes to `./qmen_zhanduan.json`.

**`tools/bin/qimen_wanwu.sh`** is the wanwu imagery extraction CLI. It supports two modes: palace mode (`--palace=N`) extracts all wanwu correspondences for a given palace from a plate JSON, and manual mode (`--stem/--star/--gate/--deity/--state`) accepts any combination of symbols directly. Each symbol is optional; at least one is required. Outputs structured text and JSON with full wanwu correspondences per symbol.

**`tools/bin/qimen_yaoce.sh`** is the yaoce (remote sensing) cross-plate analysis CLI. It reads both the birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`) and event plate (`./qmen_event.json`), extracts five stem types from the birth plate (day stem, hour stem, birth year stem, zhifu palace heaven stem, zhishi palace heaven stem), locates each on the event plate, detects six-harm and collects wanwu correspondences per palace, and outputs structured cross-plate analysis JSON to `./qmen_yaoce.json`. Supports `--yixiang=CONCEPT` to add an optional yixiang concept stem (e.g. `--yixiang=财富` maps to 戊; direct stem characters like `--yixiang=甲` are also accepted).

## Data Files

## Computation Pipeline

The engine function `qm_compute_plate` executes the following steps in order:

1. **Four Pillars (四柱干支).** Compute the year, month, day, and hour pillars. Each pillar is a Tiangan-Dizhi pair drawn from the sexagenary cycle, derived from calendar math.

2. **Ju Determination (局数).** Identify the current solar term, then determine which Yuan (上元/中元/下元, upper/middle/lower) the current day falls within. Look up the Ju number from the mapping table. If the date falls in an intercalary gap (between the Jie boundary and the next Yuan start), apply Zhi-Run: carry forward the previous Ju number.

3. **Earth Plate (地盘).** Lay the nine instruments (三奇六仪) onto the nine palaces according to the Ju number and Yin/Yang Dun (阴遁/阳遁) direction.

4. **Zhifu and Zhishi (值符值使).** Identify the duty star (Zhifu, 值符) and duty gate (Zhishi, 值使) from the hour pillar's position on the earth plate.

5. **Heaven Plate Rotation (天盘).** Rotate the nine stars from their default palaces by an offset derived from the hour pillar, placing each star into its new palace position.

6. **Human Plate Rotation (人盘).** Rotate the eight gates using the Earthly Branch step method, shifting gates from their default palaces based on the hour branch offset.

7. **Deity Plate (神盘).** Place the eight deities starting from the Zhifu star's palace, following the Yang or Yin sequence depending on Dun direction.

8. **Twelve Growth Stages (十二长生).** Compute the lifecycle state (birth, growth, peak, decline, grave, etc.) for each palace based on the day stem's wuxing.

9. **Liuyi Jixing (六仪击刑).** Check whether any of the six Yi instruments land in a palace that carries a punishment (刑) relationship with their associated Earthly Branch.

10. **Kongwang (空亡).** Determine the two void/empty Branches from the hour pillar's position within its sexagenary decade, then map those Branches to palaces.

11. **Yima (驿马).** Derive the courier horse Branch from the hour Branch using the traditional formula, then map it to a palace.

12. **Pattern Markers (格局).** Scan each palace for significant configurations:

| Marker | Chinese | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `[庚]` | 天盘庚 | Geng on the heaven plate (inauspicious metal energy) |
| `[干墓]` | 干入墓 | Heaven stem enters its grave palace |
| `[星墓]` | 星入墓 | Star enters its grave palace |
| `[门墓]` | 门入墓 | Gate enters its grave palace |
| `[门迫]` | 门迫 | Gate oppresses palace (gate's wuxing overcomes palace's wuxing) |
| `[星反吟]` | 星反吟 | Star sits in the palace opposite its home (reversal) |
| `[门反吟]` | 门反吟 | Gate sits in the palace opposite its home (reversal) |
| `[星伏吟]` | 星伏吟 | Star sits in its own home palace (stagnation) |
| `[门伏吟]` | 门伏吟 | Gate sits in its own home palace (stagnation) |
| `[击刑]` | 六仪击刑 | Six-instrument punishment |
| `[空亡]` | 空亡 | Void/empty |
| `[驿马]` | 驿马 | Courier horse (mobility indicator) |
| `[迫制]` | 十干迫制 | Heaven stem's wuxing overcomes earth stem's wuxing (suppression) |
| `全盘伏吟` | (composite) | All 8 stars in their home palaces — total stagnation |
| `全盘反吟` | (composite) | All 8 stars in their opposite palaces — total reversal |
| `乙奇升殿` | 乙在巽4 | Yi-stem in Xun-4 palace (auspicious) |
| `丙奇升殿` | 丙在离9 | Bing-stem in Li-9 palace (auspicious) |
| `丁奇升殿` | 丁在兑7 | Ding-stem in Dui-7 palace (auspicious) |

**演卦 (Yigua)** convention: 值符宫 → 内卦 (lower trigram), 值使宫 → 外卦 (upper trigram). Sourced from kentang/kinqimen tradition. Per-palace 门方演卦 also emitted (door bagua → upper, palace bagua → lower).

## Output

Two output modes are available.

**Text mode** (default) prints a header block followed by a palace-by-palace listing:

**JSON mode** is always-on: every run writes a structured JSON file (based on `--type`) containing all header fields and an array of palace objects, each with every computed field. The text output is displayed on the terminal simultaneously.

Each plate JSON includes a top-level `schema_version: 2` field. Increment this when adding/removing top-level fields to enable downstream version detection.

**special_patterns** are emitted as `[{"name": "XX", "palaces": [N]}]` objects (not strings), allowing future cross-palace patterns to use multi-palace arrays.

## Analysis Script

The event analysis script `qimen_event.sh` reads a plate JSON (produced by `qimen_qiju.sh`), enriches it with wanwu correspondence data, marks yongshen (use god) palaces based on the question type, and outputs a structured analysis JSON.

### Pipeline

```bash
# Step 1: Generate birth plate
tools/bin/qimen_qiju.sh --type=birth "1973-04-24 19:30"
# Creates ./qmen_birth.json

# Step 2: Generate event plate
tools/bin/qimen_qiju.sh --type=event "2026-04-18 10:00"
# Creates ./qmen_event.json

# Step 3: Run analysis
tools/bin/qimen_event.sh --question=事业
# Reads ./qmen_event.json, writes ./qmen_event_analysis.json
```

### Question Types

| Type | Meaning | Primary Yongshen |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 事业 | Career / official prospects | 开门 (Open Gate), 天心 (Tianxin Star) |
| 求财 | Wealth / financial matters | 生门 (Life Gate), 六合 (Liuhe Deity) |
| 婚姻感情 | Marriage / relationships | 六合 (Liuhe), 景门 (View Gate), 乙 (Yi Stem) |
| 疾病健康 | Health / illness | 天内 (Tiannei Star), 死门 (Death Gate) |
| 出行 | Travel / movement | 开门 (Open Gate), 九天 (Jiutian Deity) |
| 官司诉讼 | Lawsuits / legal disputes | 伤门 (Harm Gate), 天英 (Tianying Star) |
| 寻人寻物 | Finding people / lost items | 六合 (Liuhe), 杜门 (Block Gate) |
| 天气 | Weather | 景门 (View Gate), 天英 (Tianying Star) |
| 家宅风水 | Home / feng shui | 生门 (Life Gate), 天任 (Tianren Star) |

### Analysis Output

The analysis JSON includes:
- Day stem and hour stem palace positions
- Yongshen (use god) markings with palace locations
- Wanwu correspondences for each palace (star, gate, deity, stems)
- 81-combination lookups for key palaces
- Pattern markers (kongwang, yima, geng, rumu, menpo, fanyin, fuyin, jixing)

## Caiguan Script (财官诊断)

The caiguan script `qimen_caiguan.sh` reads the birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`) only. It performs wealth/career deep analysis. It locates seven hazard elements (七要害) for both wealth and career dimensions, detects six-harm (六害: punishment, tomb, Geng, White Tiger, gate oppression, void) at each palace, computes monthly decree wuxing relationships with Chinese meaning labels (扩张/稳健/努力/损耗/大亏), traces controlled-wealth stems (干财) with five-combination fallback (missing 甲 uses zhifu palace stem instead of 己), and auto-derives industry symbols from the plate. The birth year stem is auto-read from `./qmen_birth.json`.

### Pipeline

```bash
# Default usage (birth plate analysis)

## Buzhen Script (布阵)

The buzhen script `qimen_huaqizhen.sh` defaults to birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`); use `--input` to specify an event plate for event-based analysis. It reads a huaqi analysis JSON and generates array placement plans. It identifies protected stems (day/hour stem, birth year stem, family stems, yixiang concept stems, zhifu/zhishi stems), scans all eight palaces for six-harm threats against protected stems (including opposite-palace influence from 玄武/庚/白虎), generates miexiang (灭象) lists with safe relocation targets, and produces per-palace buzhen plans (suppress jixing via combination, suppress rumu via clash, suppress menpo via combination, neutralize geng/baihu via yi-stem, fill kongwang gaps) with physical object imagery mapping. The birth year stem is auto-read from `./qmen_birth.json`.

### Pipeline

## Yishenhuanjiang Script (移神换将化解)

The yishenhuanjiang script `qimen_yishenhuanjiang.sh` reads the birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`) and performs transformation-based resolution analysis. Unlike the buzhen script which uses pressure/suppression (灭象+布阵), yishenhuanjiang uses removal (灭象), combination (合), drainage (泄), clash (冲), and supplement (补) to transform harmful energy. It scans all palaces for six-harm problems (击刑, 干墓, 门迫, 空亡, 庚, 白虎), computes per-problem resolution paths with physical object imagery (灭象 as mandatory first path for 击刑/干墓/庚), groups problems by palace, and includes jinji (禁忌) warnings and yindong (引动) activation methods.

### Pipeline

```bash

## True Solar Time Calculator (真太阳时)

The `qimen_zhentaiyangshi.sh` utility converts between standard clock time and true solar time. Two modes: **forward** (clock time → true solar time + shichen) and **reverse** (shichen → clock time window). True solar time is required for accurate shichen (时辰) determination in Qi Men practice, especially when the practitioner is far from the standard meridian of their timezone. The tool applies longitude correction (4 minutes per degree of longitude difference) and the Equation of Time (seasonal correction for Earth's elliptical orbit).

`--longitude` and `--timezone` are mutually exclusive: provide one to auto-derive the other. Default: UTC+8 at 120°E.

### Pipeline

```bash
# Forward: Beijing (116.4°E, longitude positioning) — clock time → true solar time
tools/bin/qimen_zhentaiyangshi.sh --longitude=116.4 "2026-04-30 14:30"

# Forward: New York (UTC-5, timezone positioning)
tools/bin/qimen_zhentaiyangshi.sh --timezone=-5 "2026-04-30 14:30"

# Reverse: what clock time is 申时 in Urumqi (longitude positioning)?
tools/bin/qimen_zhentaiyangshi.sh --shichen=申时 --longitude=87.6 "2026-04-30"

# Reverse: what clock time is 子时 in New York (timezone positioning)?
tools/bin/qimen_zhentaiyangshi.sh --shichen=子 --timezone=-5 "2026-04-30"
```

### CLI Reference

```
Usage: qimen_zhentaiyangshi.sh [OPTIONS] "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
       qimen_zhentaiyangshi.sh --shichen=X [OPTIONS] "YYYY-MM-DD"

  --timezone=N          Timezone offset (longitude defaults to standard meridian)
                        Mutually exclusive; omit both for default UTC+8 at 120°E
  --shichen=X           Reverse query: input shichen, output clock time window

## Hunlian Script (婚恋分析)

The hunlian script `qimen_hunlian.sh` reads the birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`) only. It performs marriage/romance analysis. It locates the birth day stem palace, identifies the gan-he (stem combination) partner, checks liuhe (six harmony) and muyu (bathing position), detects taohua (peach blossom) indicators across multiple dimensions (xuanwu, taiyin, ren/gui, sanqi co-location), scans fuyin/fanyin palaces, evaluates kongwang impact on partner positions, inspects gen/kun palace six-harm, computes guchen/guasu (lonely star) with jiehua remedies, and tracks special positions (tianpeng, shangmen, ding, gui). The birth day stem is auto-read from `./qmen_birth.json`.

### Pipeline

```bash
# Default usage (birth plate analysis)

## Xunshijieyun Script (寻时借运)

The xunshijieyun script `qimen_xunshijieyun.sh` reads a plate JSON and generates 60 variant plates by cycling through all 60 甲子 time pillars with fixed 局数. It ranks each variant by total 六害 (six harms) on protected stems and outputs sortable JSON files. The first file in `ls 60ke/` is always the optimal course.

## Zhanduan Script (古籍占断)

The zhanduan script `qimen_zhanduan.sh` applies divination judgment rules from "Qi Men Zhi Gui" (《奇门旨归》) volumes 6-13 to an event plate. It reads `rules_zhanduan.dat` which encodes ancient text judgment criteria in a custom DSL, resolves role stems (日干, 时干, 年干, 用神, custom named roles) to their palace positions on the plate, evaluates wuxing relationship and state conditions between roles, and collects all matched conclusions. AI then explains the conclusions in plain language.

### Pipeline

```bash
# Generate event plate

## Wanwu Script (万物类象提取)

The wanwu script `qimen_wanwu.sh` extracts full wanwu (万物类象) correspondences for a set of Qi Men symbols. Two input modes: palace mode reads symbols from a plate JSON, manual mode accepts symbols directly. At least one symbol is required in manual mode. Outputs structured text and JSON with all correspondence fields per symbol.

## Yaoce Script (遥测 / Array-Breaking)

The yaoce script `qimen_yaoce.sh` performs cross-plate remote sensing, the diagnostic phase of array-breaking (破阵). The event plate represents a "natural array" (天然阵): a time-space configuration that has already formed and is exerting influence on the subject. Yaoce reads this array by placing the subject's protected stems from the birth plate onto the event plate, then assessing what harm the array inflicts on each stem.

It reads both the birth plate (`./qmen_birth.json`) and the event plate (`./qmen_event.json`), extracts five stem types from the birth plate: day stem (日干), hour stem (时干), birth year stem (生年干), zhifu palace heaven stem (值符宫干), and zhishi palace heaven stem (值使宫干). It then locates each on the event plate (heaven plate priority, earth plate fallback). For each stem's landing palace, it collects the full palace environment (heaven/earth stems, star, gate, deity, state, markers), detects six-harm (六害: punishment, tomb, Geng, White Tiger, gate oppression, void), and extracts wanwu correspondences. An optional yixiang (意象) concept stem can be added via `--yixiang`, either as a concept name (e.g. `财富` → maps to 戊) or as a direct stem character (e.g. `甲`). The output feeds into two follow-up actions: miexiang (灭象, urgent removal of harmful symbols) and full re-layout via `qimen_huaqizhen.sh` (布阵, systematic counter-array placement).

### Pipeline

```bash
# Step 1: Generate birth plate
tools/bin/qimen_qiju.sh --type=birth "1973-04-24 19:30"

`SKILL.md` files in the `skills/` directory define OpenCode AI skills for conversational interpretation.

**`qmen_dunjia`** is the unified router skill. When the user says "Qi Men Dun Jia" without a clear analysis direction, this skill takes over to (1) force a triage between event time vs. birth time, (2) perform the entry blessing ritual, (3) call `qimen_qiju.sh` to generate the appropriate plate JSON, and (4) hand off to the right sub-skill. Sub-skills detect the existing plate JSON and skip their own plate-setting step. The router never performs analysis itself. When user intent is ambiguous after a birth plate is generated, the router presents a 3-choice menu (全局总览 / 财运事业 / 性格分析) rather than silently defaulting to the heaviest skill.

**`qmen_event`** drives event plate reading (问事局): run analysis → narrative reading → follow-up. Maps free-text questions to 9 standard question types. Can only be invoked via `qmen_dunjia` router (which handles ritual and plate generation). Used exclusively for event plates; birth plate analysis uses the huaqizhen skill family (caiguan, hunlian, xingge, huaqizhen).

**`qmen_caiguan`** (财官诊断) drives wealth/career diagnosis: generate birth plate → run caiguan analysis → diagnose seven hazards for wealth and career → "step on one, lift the other" advice. Birth year stem is auto-read from `qmen_birth.json`. Uses birth plate only.

**`qmen_huaqizhen`** (化气阵布阵) drives array placement: generate birth plate (event plate optional, only when targeting a specific event) → generate buzhen → miexiang + physical object recommendations.

**`qmen_yishenhuanjiang`** (移神换将化解) drives transformation-based resolution: generate birth plate → run yishenhuanjiang analysis → AI interprets per-problem resolution paths with physical object recommendations and activation methods. Unlike huaqizhen (pressure/suppression), yishenhuanjiang uses 灭象 (removal), 合 (combination), 泄 (drainage), 冲 (clash), and 补 (supplement) to transform harmful energy rather than suppress it.

**`qmen_hunlian`** (婚恋分析) drives marriage/romance interpretation: generate birth plate → run hunlian analysis → interpret across 5 modules (tuodan, sishou, cui_taohua, zhan_taohua, qingqu) plus 4 common modules. Uses birth plate only.

**`qmen_xingge`** (性格分析) drives personality interpretation: generate birth plate → run personality analysis → AI synthesizes inner (day stem) and outer (hour stem) personality profiles from the combined stem/star/gate/deity traits at each palace.

**`qmen_xunshijieyun`** (寻时借运) drives the 幻化六十课 mechanism — the third resolution method (换局) independent of miexiang and buzhen: generates 60 variant plates → ranks by liuhai on protected stems → presents optimal course(s) → guides user to recreate the favorable time-space layout by arranging physical objects per palace's wanwu correspondences. For event plates, interacts with user to determine yixiang concept stem. For birth plates, runs directly. Handles tie-breaking when multiple courses share the lowest liuhai count.

**`qmen_zhanduan`** (古籍占断) executes divination judgments based on ancient text rules from "Qi Men Zhi Gui" (《奇门旨归》volumes 6-13). The script evaluates DSL-encoded rules against the event plate: resolves role stems (日干/时干/年干/用神/custom) to palace positions, evaluates wuxing relationships and state conditions between roles, and collects all matched conclusions. AI then explains the conclusions in plain language.

**`qmen_luming`** (禄命总览 / Full Life Overview) provides a complete six-relation life reading with 3 perspective modes. It calls `qimen_luming.sh` for deterministic six-relation computation (with correct 六甲遁干 substitution per year branch) plus deity verdicts (神性情 / 神论命 / 神喜忌), then AI interprets across six life domains (parents, siblings, children, career, spouse/wealth, health). Three perspective modes: 奇门大师 (comprehensive), 军师 (strategy-focused), 法术奇门 (ritual-focused). For 问事 (event-divination) intent, the router redirects to `qmen_event` instead (correct plate type).

**`qmen_wanwu`** (万物类象画像) generates creative imagery portraits from Qi Men symbol combinations. Three modes: scene (environment/atmosphere), object (shape/color/material/function), and person (appearance/temperament/behavior). Symbols are flexibly mapped to dimensions (each symbol used once), with twelve growth stages as lowest-priority modifier. Supports iterative refinement (style, domain, era adjustments) within wanwu data bounds.

**`qmen_yaoce`** (遥测 / 破阵) drives cross-plate array-breaking analysis in an 8-step flow. The event plate is treated as a natural array (天然阵) that has already formed and is affecting the subject; yaoce diagnoses this array, measures its harm on the subject's protected stems, then plans counter-measures. Flow: collects birth time and event time → ritual reminder → generates both plates → **diagnoses natural array** (AI reads event plate: six-harm distribution, array pattern, overall assessment) → **locates native** (runs yaoce script: places 5 protected stem types on event plate, namely day stem, hour stem, birth year stem, zhifu palace stem, zhishi palace stem; detects six-harm, extracts wanwu) → **assesses harm** (AI interprets each stem's palace via 6-module framework: day+hour contrast, birth year root, zhifu/zhishi authority, scene reconstruction, yixiang concept, re-layout plan) → interactive inquiry to refine yixiang concept stem (optional re-run with `--yixiang`) → **re-layout** (step 1: miexiang urgent removal of harmful symbols identified during diagnosis; step 2: guides user to `qmen_huaqizhen` for systematic counter-array placement).

## Installation

Run `install.sh` to symlink the project into your OpenCode skills directory and make the CLI executable:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

This creates a symlink for each `qmen_*` sub-skill in the OpenCode skills directory (e.g. `qmen_dunjia`, `qmen_event`, `qmen_caiguan`, `qmen_huaqizhen`, `qmen_hunlian`, `qmen_xingge`, `qmen_wanwu`, `qmen_yaoce`). Each skill sub-directory also contains relative symlinks (`bin`, `data`, `lib`) pointing to the project's tools directory, so AI agents can resolve the project root at runtime without hardcoded paths. Restart OpenCode to load the skills.

## Requirements

**Shell:** Bash 3.2 or later. No external dependencies: no Python, no bc, no awk, no GNU coreutils extensions.
